# MO-IT110 -Object Oriented Programing

# About

MotorPH was established in 2020 to provide private transportation options to Filipinos. Our goal is to be the first choice of Filipinos who are searching for competitive and affordable motorcycles.


# Project

In this Java project, we will create a console application that interacts through a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. 

The program will take input and produce output via the GUI components such as windows, buttons, text fields, and labels. GUI Java Swing allows users to interact with the program visually, offering a more intuitive and user-friendly experience compared to traditional command-line interfaces (CLI). While CLI was historically prevalent in the 1960s through the 1980s, GUI Java Swing has become the primary interface for modern computing, catering to diverse user preferences and needs.
